            "ESTIMATED EVIDENCE: The Grassy Knoll trailhead in Gifford Pinchot National Forest is reached via forest and county roads that are commonly seasonally closed or become impassable in winter; if roads remain open, travel frequently requires chains or 4WD and motorists must comply with posted traction requirements. USFS typically does not plow forest roads, so winter access is limited; WSDOT is responsible for plowing and posting conditions on state highways, while Skamania or Klickitat County handle their county roads but often provide only limited plowing. Winter vehicle advisories, closures, and traction requirements are issued by the local USFS district, WSDOT, and the relevant county and are enforced where posted.",

Baker–Snoqualmie NF is reached via forest and connector roads that are commonly subject to seasonal winter closures and often are not plowed; during winter access typically requires a snow-capable vehicle (4WD or AWD) and chains/traction devices when conditions warrant. The U.S. Forest Service issues and enforces winter road closures, gate schedules, and trailhead parking restrictions; WSDOT controls and plows the state highways to the trailhead junction and issues chain-law and traction advisories during storms; Snohomish County Public Works plows county-maintained roads but generally does not plow remote forest roads. Travelers should expect limited plowing, possible gated or closed access, and must follow USFS, WSDOT, and county winter advisories and chain/4WD requirements.",
