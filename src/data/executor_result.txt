            "- Common cost-efficiency metrics mentioned:\n  - LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) — power-plant level measure (cost to build and operate a plant without making a loss); does not include system integration costs and is considered inappropriate by the IEA for systems with high shares of wind/solar.\n  - System LCOE — LCOE plus all system costs (integration/profile, balancing, transmission/grid, losses, reactive power, etc.).\n  - ACOE (Actual Cost of Electricity) — LCOE plus profile cost (accounts for declining electricity market value and reduced capacity factor due to overcapacity from increasing weather-dependent generation).\n  - LFSCOE (Levelized Full System Costs of Electricity) — cost of a system where 100% of demand is covered by a single power type (used to indicate cost of a 100% renewable system).\n  - (Implicitly noted) profile costs, balancing costs and grid/transmission costs are treated as separate system-cost components to be added to plant-level metrics.\n\n- Components classed as “system costs”:\n  - Profile costs (how production variability affects capacity factor and market price)\n  - Balancing costs (keeping supply-demand balance)\n  - Grid/transmission costs and losses\n  - Frequency control, reactive power, system inertia, regulating capacity\n\n- Empirical/numeric examples relating to Germany:\n  - Manzolini et al. (2024) — based on 2022 data: when wind share increases from 0% to 50%, wind cost per kWh (ACOE-type effect) rises in Germany from SEK 0.9 to SEK 1.4 per kWh.\n  - Idel (2022) — LFSCOE values per kWh for Germany (100% system of given type): nuclear SEK 1.11/kWh; wind SEK 5.28/kWh; solar SEK 16.21/kWh.\n  - Ueckerdt et al. (2013) — analyzing system LCOE: integration cost was significant already at 20% wind market share; above 20% integration cost increases rapidly, and at 40% market share the system-level cost was doubled.\n  - OECD-NEA reported similar findings on rising integration/system costs with increasing shares of weather-dependent generation.\n\n- Additional relevant points:\n  - A high share of weather-dependent generation reduces utilization and market value of balancing/dispatchable plants, increasing their required remuneration and raising overall system costs.\n  - The page emphasizes that power-plant LCOE alone understates true social/system costs in high wind/solar systems; hence system-level measures (system LCOE, ACOE, LFSCOE) are used to capture integration and external costs.",
            "Extracted factual content relevant to definitions and formulas for system LCOE and total system cost\n\nDefinitions / core formulas\n\n- LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) definition (as given):\n  LCOE = [ I + sum_{t=0..N} OM / (1 + r)^t ]  /  [ sum_{t=0..N} EY (1 − deg)^t / (1 + r)^t ]\n  where:\n  - I = initial investment for installation of the system\n  - OM = annual operation and maintenance expenses\n  - EY = energy yield in the first year of the system (kWh)\n  - N = total project lifetime in years\n  - deg = annual module degradation rate\n  - r = nominal discount rate for the customer\n\n- Energy yield (EY) dependence:\n  EY = f(h; A; Nm; YS; …)\n  where h = module (cell) efficiency, A = module area, Nm = number of modules, YS = specific (AC) energy yield for the location, etc. (often estimated by multiplying these parameters).\n\n- Relation between manufacturing cost and initial investment:\n  I = Cm, A, Nm + BOS\n  where:\n  - Cm = manufacturing cost for a module (noted in the paper as $/m2)\n  - BOS = aggregated balance-of-system costs (inverters, manual labor, racking, permits, land costs, etc.)\n  (Cm in $/m2 can be converted to $/W by standard geometry/power calculations for the module.)\n\nIso-LCOE condition and Value of Efficiency (VOE)\n\n- Iso-LCOE condition (co-varying efficiency and manufacturing cost to keep LCOE constant):\n  LCOE(h + dh; Cm + ΔCm(dh)) = LCOE(h; Cm)\n\n- Value of efficiency (VOE) definition:\n  VOE = ΔCm(dh) / dh\n  VOE gives the allowable additional module fabrication cost (in $/m2) per 1% absolute increase in module efficiency that leaves LCOE unchanged (i.e., the maximum allowable added manufacturing cost for a given efficiency improvement).\n\n- Analytical representation (as presented in the paper):\n  VOE = k \x02 Csys \x02 CP \x03  (Equation 6 in text)\n  with the textual description:\n  - k is a conversion factor with a value of 10 W m2\n  - Csys is the total system cost in $/W\n  - CP is the sum of all cost contributions that scale with the total wattage (power) of the PV system, given in $/W\n  (The paper notes that determining CP is non-trivial and discusses how to obtain it; see notes below.)\n\nPower-dependent portion of system cost (CP) and how to estimate it\n\n- CP definition:\n  CP is the portion of overall system cost that scales with system power (units $/W). Examples of cost items typically assumed to scale with system power and thus included in CP:\n  - inverters\n  - cables and wires\n  - electrical installation labor\n  - interconnection costs\n\n- Practical approach (thought experiment) to identify CP:\n  Consider a fixed-size PV installation (fixed racks, layout, work hours). Replace modules with slightly more efficient ones (small absolute change, e.g., 0.1% efficiency) so the overall layout need not change. Costs that change linearly with the change in nominal system power constitute CP. Costs that do not scale with power (e.g., fixed permit fees, fixed scaffolding, certain BOS items) are excluded from CP.\n\nOther relevant numeric/empirical notes from the paper\n\n- Conversion factor used in Equation 6: k = 10 W m2 (stated in the text).\n- The paper estimates the ratio CP / Csys (power-dependent cost as fraction of total system cost) from international data to be roughly 30% ± 8%; the US value used in the paper is 28.5%.\n- The paper emphasizes the distinction between module cost units: Cm is given in $/m2 in their derivations (many sources quote $/W, so careful conversion is required when applying formulas that use $/m2).\n\nNotes on application and limitations (as stated)\n- VOE is derived from LCOE and depends on accurate estimates of total system cost (Csys), the power-scaling portion CP, and lifetime energy production (EY). The paper notes non-linear effects (e.g., changes in temperature coefficient or degradation) are not included in the basic VOE linear approximation unless explicitly adjusted.\n- Determining CP in practice varies by installation and bookkeeping practices; the paper provides a detailed example and supporting material for computing CP (not reproduced here).",
